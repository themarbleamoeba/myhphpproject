Find somebody to give you what you need<br>
You can't seem to feel the need, oh<br>
The lack of love when I hold you close to my soul<br>
Then It start... it get a little colder<br>
...<br>
Take control before your day just gets away<br>
Time flies now its going faster<br>
How'd you get to the point where theres no delay<br>
I need a pause, and then a play<br>
Rewind to a time when it wasn’t so kind,<br>
fast forward, it’s moving too fast<br>
eeehhhhh......<br>
See what it sounds like, alright man<br>
See what it sounds like<br>
See what it sounds like, alright<br>
See what it sounds like, alright man<br>
See what it sounds like<br>
 ...<br>
Its looking up....<br>
Before it turned to grey<br>
Another drink ... before it all just blurs away<br>
And after that your laying flat on your back,<br>
Ah wasted...<br>
OOOHHHH<br>
It's gravity now<br>
What'd ya say<br>
What'd ya say<br>
Can you hear it, it's alright man<br>
What'd ya say<br>
What'd ya say<br> 
Can you hear it<br>
...<br>
It's dark as night and seems your losing your way now<br>
You finally realize there's not much more to say now<br>
You focus in you focus on and<br>
there's more to your day now<br>
Oooohhhh<br>
Clarity shines<br>
What'd you say<br> 
What'd you say<br> 
Can you hear it, it's alright man<br>
What'd you say<br> 
What'd you say<br> 
Can you hear it<br>
Aaahhhhh

There goes the money<br>
There goes the greed<br> 
There goes the money<br>
and There goes me<br>
If I had the money<br>
Would I buy those fancy clothes?<br>
If I had the money<br>
Would I have a runny nose?<br>
If that money, was growing on the trees<br>
Would I stand there picking money<br>
 or ever ever leave?<br>
AAAHHHH<br>
I.... will get by<br>
Gotta make the cheddar<br>
Gotta stack that dough<br>
Gotta pay them bills<br>
But my pockets ain't swole<br>
I.... will survive<br>
...<br>
That dirty money will spend the same<br>
The rich get richer and the poor... they stays the same<br>
If I had a pile as big as a house<br>
Would I spend it all on useless shit<br>
 or help a brother out?<br>
If that money wasn’t anywhere in the world<br>
Would people get along and would there still be war?<br>
AAAHHH<br>
I.... will get by<br>
Its hard to get ahead when they hold you down<br>
They try to slow you down and you found<br>
That it ain't working out<br>
I.... will survive<br>
You're bound to get ahaead if you give it your all<br> 
You're gonna grind all the time<br>
Even if you fall<br>
Your get back up and go again<br>
I.... will survive<br>

You don’t have to wait for me<br> 
You don’t have to pray for me<br>
You don’t have to say to me<br>
That the fires all gone<br>
It went out a long time ago<br>
The fire went out so long ago<br>
Seems like I can't even see my dreams<br>
Not matter what will be will be<br>
Throw a bottle into the sea<br>
And watch it float out on<br>
You're watching it float so far away<br> 
You're watching it float so far away now<br>
It will wash ashore some day now<br>
Open it up, and what does it say now<br>
Looking up with a widely gaze, you were,<br> 
staring at the stars<br> 
Hoping someone would answer the page<br>
There is someone across the way<br>
Reaching out to brighten your day<br>
Left it up to the sea to save<br>
And then it rode out, on...<br>
On.. that mighty wave now<br>
You're watchin it float so far away now.
